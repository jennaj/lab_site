## Galaxy

Galaxy is an open, web-based platform for reproducible data intensive biomedical research. It is used by thousands of users worldwide to make sense of large datasets generated by next-generation sequencing technologies. Our main site perfomes over 5,000 analyses daily.

## Mutation dynamics

Next-Generation sequencing technologies allow us to detect nucleotide changes at very high resolution. Unfortunately the signal is often obscured by noise. We are using cutting edge technologies such as ddPCR to overcome these challenges and understand mutational flicker.

## Reproducibility in Biology

Many of today's publications utilizing advanced sequencing technologies cannot be readily reproduced due to the lack of primary data, software, and analytical details. We are working on raising awarness of these issues and developing software for making modern life-sciences transparent.
